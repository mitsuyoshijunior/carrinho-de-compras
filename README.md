This project was developed as part of a programming logic course by Alura.

## How It Works

This is a simple project where customers can choose products and add them to the shopping cart. The application displays the unit price, multiplies it by the quantity desired, and shows the final total price.

## Technologies Used

- HTML (provided by Alura)  
- CSS (provided by Alura)  
- JavaScript (custom logic developed by me)
